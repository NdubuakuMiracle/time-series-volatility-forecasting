# Time-Series Volatility Forecasting 

## Project Overview  
This project performs a **comprehensive financial time series analysis and volatility forecasting** for stocks, specifically **Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL)**. It includes:  
- **Volatility modeling** using **GARCH**  
- An **interactive Streamlit web application** for real-time forecasting  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to compare price trends and risk characteristics  
- **Dynamic visualizations** to analyze stock performance  

The **forecasting web application is hosted on Render**, providing an accessible platform for users to interactively forecast stock volatility and explore historical trends.

## Project Structure  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Import & Processing  
- **Data Source**: Stock price data is **fetched dynamically** from the **Alpha Vantage API**.  
- **Processor**: The `APIStockProcessor` class handles:  
  - Retrieving stock data  
  - Data cleaning and transformation  
  - Computation of **daily returns**  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Microsoft vs. Apple  
A comparative **EDA** is performed to understand the differences in price movement, risk exposure, and volatility characteristics between **Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL)** stocks.  

- **Price Trends & Returns**:  
  - **Closing Prices**: Visual comparison of long-term stock performance.  
  - **Daily Returns Distribution**: Analysis of risk and return profiles.  

- **Volatility & Risk Assessment**:  
  - **Rolling 30-Day Volatility**: Measures fluctuations over time.  
  - **Squared Returns Plot**: Identifies **volatility clustering** (essential for GARCH modeling).  
  - **Autocorrelation Analysis (ACF & PACF)**: Detects patterns in stock volatility.  
  - **Annualized Volatility Calculation**:  
    - Apple stock demonstrates **higher annualized volatility**, implying **greater risk exposure**.  
    - Microsoft stock exhibits **more stable return patterns**.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Volatility Forecasting - GARCH Model  
The **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model** is employed to model and forecast Microsoft's (MSFT) stock price volatility.  

- **Model Insights**:  
  - The **mean return (Œº)** is statistically significant, confirming **non-zero expected returns**.  
  - **GARCH Parameters**:  
    - **œâ (Omega)**: Baseline volatility (not significant).  
    - **Œ± (Alpha[1])**: Past stock shocks **strongly influence** current volatility.  
    - **Œ≤ (Beta[1])**: High persistence in volatility, meaning past fluctuations impact future volatility significantly.  

- **Practical Use**:  
  - Traders can use these insights to assess **risk periods**.  
  - Investors can incorporate **volatility predictions** into their trading strategies.

## Deployment  

### üåê Interactive Forecasting App (Streamlit)  
A **fully interactive web app** built with **Streamlit** enables users to:  
‚úÖ **Input a stock ticker** (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT).  
‚úÖ **Choose data limit** (full dataset or a custom limit).  
‚úÖ **Set forecast days** (1-30 days).  
‚úÖ **Enable annualized volatility** (optional).  
‚úÖ Fetch **live stock data**  
‚úÖ Compute **returns & volatility**  
‚úÖ Visualize **trend charts**, **returns**, and **forecasted volatility**.  

**App Deployment:** Hosted on **Render** for real-time access.
